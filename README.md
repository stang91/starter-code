# starter-code

located within the folder are the necessary files needed for the website.
I have edited the code and add semantic HTML elements to it and also follow a logical structure.
I also add some alt attriutes to the image elements in HTML.
The heading attributes are edited to fall in sequential order, with h1,h2,h3,h4.
I also add and edit the title element renaming it to "Horiseon - frontpage."
